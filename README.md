# Crowdfunding_ETL 
Project 2
For Project 2 I worked solo to perform ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) with the dataset in excel called Crowdfunding. 
This dataset included information on crowdfunding campaigns including company names, goals, pledges, launch and end dates of the campaign and categories of campaigns.
I used Jupiter Notebook, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods regular to extract and transform the data.
After transforming the data, I created (4) CSV files to create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram). 
My last step was to load the CSV file data to a Postgres database.
